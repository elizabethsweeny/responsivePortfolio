      <img src="assets/images/elizabeth_sm_headshot.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Elizabeth Sweeny">

      <p>I am a Mountain View native, born and raised. I have a Bachelors of Commerce in Business Management, with a pre-law emphasis and a Middle Eastern Foreign Policy minor. I have a Masters in Computer Science and Engineering.</p>

      <p>I am currently a Product Manager on the Chrome Web Platform team, with a focus on Developer Insights. Most recently, I was Director of Corporate Innovation at GSVlabs, and Director of Programs and Partnerships for the Frugal Innovation Hub at Santa Clara University. I still teach a graduate engineering course 'Engineering for the Developing World,' every Fall quarter at Santa Clara University</p>

      <p>I am taking this bootcamp to ensure that I can be better at my job, and empathize with developer needs far more deeply.</p>
